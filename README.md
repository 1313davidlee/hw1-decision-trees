# HW1: Decision trees for EECS 349 @ NU

In this assignment, the goals are:
- Understand the exponential growth of a hypothesis space
- Understand and implement evaluation measures for machine learning algorithms
- Write code that helps you to visualize and understand a dataset
- Implement information gain and entropy measures
- Implement a decision tree with the ID3 algorithm
- Understand the extension of decision trees to random forest

## Clone this repository

o clone this repository run the following command:

``git clone https://github.com/nucs349/hw1-decision-trees-[your_username]``

`[your_username]` is replaced in the above link by your Github username. Alternatively, just look at the link in your address bar if you're viewing this README in your submission repository in a browser. Once cloned, `cd` into the cloned repository. Every assignment has some files that you edit to complete it. 

## Files you edit

See problems.md for what files you will edit.

Do not edit anything in the `tests` directory. Files can be added to `tests` but files that exist already cannot be edited. Modifications to tests will be checked for. Do not edit `.travis.yml`. This is used by Travis to test your code! 

## Environment setup
